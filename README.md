# MindCar
* A serious game which aims to control brainwaves, by using Neurofeedback concept that is self-controlling of brain state through the feedback of his own brain dynamics. 
* Developed under various open-source platforms (OpenViBE platform, O2U, Unity3d) for higher portability. 
* has various modes such as Individual mode(single-player) and Competition mode(multi-player). Individual mode has user-controlled driving and autonomous driving modes. 
* evaluated the usability and overall maturity of MindCar by conducting demonstrations and surveys to the general public.


# Objectives
* researchers studying brain such as biofeedback, neurofeedback, and hyper-scanning can easily utilize this application for their study and save times.
