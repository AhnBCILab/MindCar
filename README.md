# MindCar
* A serious game which aims to control brainwaves, by using Neurofeedback concept that is self-controlling of brain state through the feedback of his own brain dynamics. 
* Developed under various open-source platforms (OpenViBE, O2U, Unity3d) for higher portability. 
* has various modes such as one or multi-player modes, and user-controlled driving or autonomous driving modes. 

# Objectives
researchers studying brain such as biofeedback, neurofeedback, and hyper-scanning can easily utilize this application for their study and save times. 

We have also evaluated the usability and overall maturity of MindCar by conducting demonstrations and surveys to the general public.
As a result, we confirmed that the positive opinions from the participants, and significant improvement of attention score 
measured by Stroop test after playing MindCar.
